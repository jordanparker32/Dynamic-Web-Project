# ITC261-Final-Project

### About 

For our final project in Intro to Web Development, we wanted to create a front page for southern miss student to be able to easily acces our most used webpages. This idea came to mind because we were tired of having to hunt down even basic things like getting to our canvas page. Through creating the project we thought of other ways we could customize our site,and we implemented a way for a user to login, and be able to create buttons that could be added to a hot access table that would allow the student to customize their experience to their needs.
